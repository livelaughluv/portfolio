										<h3>GitHub Notes</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										This year, we took notes using GitHub. Each student created programs (I used Python on Replit) that
										allowed users to choose which notes they would like to read. Once they typed in their option, the users
										could see the notes for that section. Some sections had sub-sections that required users to choose 
										another option. Click this button to access the GitHub repository where I stored my notes.

										<h3><a>Top Notes</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										While I took notes on all of the lessons we had this quarter, I'll summarize my top three 
										lessons here.
									</p>
									<div class="row gtr-50">
										<div class="col-8">
											<h4>Starting Systems (8/30/22)</h4>
											<p>
												This lesson was about systems and system changeovers. It was one of my favorite 
												lessons I took notes on because we had already started learning about the subject 
												last year (IB Comp Sci Year 1), but we began to go more in depth this year. I enjoyed
												reviewing what I already knew and learning new things at the same time.
											</small></p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-8">
											<h4>System Design (9/6/22)</h4>
											<p><small>
												This lesson was about, as you probably guessed by the title, types of system designs. 
												The content was not what I truly enjoyed about this lesson (not that it wasn't enjoyable,
												just that I chose this as one of my top three lessons for another reason), it was that while
												coding the notes for this lesson I first extended my code to include extra sub-sections and 
												choices for the user to learn about. It was a bit difficult and broke my brain at first,
												but I was very happy once I got it to work.
											</small></p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-8">
											<h4>Ethics and Impacts of IT (9/26/22)</h4>
											<p><small>
												This lesson was about the ethics and impacts of IT (no duh). This lesson is one of my top 
												three lessons because I was able to connect Computer Science to another IB course, Theory of 
												Knowledge. TOK is very interesting for me, and I enjoyed exploring the TOK side of Computer 
												Science.

										This is the mad lib that my group completed to start off our first nine weeks project. I thought it

											<h3>Barbershop Services + Improvements</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The project for this quarter was to research common services and how they organize their data. 
											My group (Thomas, Helen and me) chose to focus on barbershops and the services they provide, as
											well as the issues with their data. We decided it is difficult to capitalize on cutting other 
											people’s hair and data is often kept physically in logbooks which is potentially dangerous, and 
											that capitalizing on a target audience and selling products specified for them and market better, 
											also keeping records digitally to further protect information and ensure data security
										</p>
										<p>
											Documentation Issues:
											Many barber shops have issues in documentation regarding which barber served which customers and 
											when; this could be solved with digital records and cloud backups to prevent the data loss common 
											with physical recordings.
										</p>
										<p>
											Training Issues: Many barbers aren’t given many formal classes; their main focus is actual practice, 
											intern work. That being said, many barbers are mistreated, overworked, and taught bad practices; 
											this could be solved by having sanctioned, monitored internships at reputable shops rather than any 
											shop of choice that may promote bad practices prior to certification.
										</p>
										<p>
											Company Data: Company data should have cloud backups and hard drive backups after passing periods or 
											major events so that one is presumably always intact, functional, and up to date. This will help 
											prevent any possible loss of transaction history, the client’s name and their barber, and other necessary 
											information to record for safety or functional purposes.
										</p>
										<p>
											Client Data: Little client data is collected at barber shops aside from possibly phone numbers and 
											payment information, a simple way of protecting this data is not saving said information as it is
											unnecessary to function as a business.
										</p>	
										<p>
											Protect and Maintain the Company: Control access of data within the company to protect against any 
											possible breaches in security while also backing up data to maintain data.
										</p>	
										<p>
											Protect and Maintain the Client: Create a data usage policy to protect clients information from 
											being misused in any way while the business has it in possession and controlling access of data to 
											further protect said data while also limiting possible any unrecorded changes.
